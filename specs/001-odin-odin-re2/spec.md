# Feature Specification: Odin RE2 Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-odin-odin-re2`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Complete RE2-compatible regular expression engine implementation in Odin

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Literal Matching (Priority: P1)

Users need to compile and match simple literal string patterns using RE2-compatible API in Odin language. This provides the foundation for all regex functionality.

**Why this priority**: Essential baseline functionality - without literal matching, no regex engine can function

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by compiling literal patterns like "hello", "test", "abc123" and verifying they match correctly in target strings

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a literal pattern "hello", **When** compiled and matched against "hello world", **Then** it should return a successful match at position 0-5
2. **Given** a literal pattern with escape sequences like "hello\nworld", **When** matched against multi-line text, **Then** it should handle escapes correctly
3. **Given** an empty pattern, **When** compiled, **Then** it should match at any position (RE2 behavior)

---

### User Story 2 - Character Classes and Special Characters (Priority: P2)

Users need to use character classes [a-z], special characters like . (dot), and basic quantifiers * + ? for more flexible pattern matching.

**Why this priority**: Expands matching capabilities beyond simple literals, enabling most common regex use cases

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by matching patterns like "[0-9]+", "a.*b", "test?" against various input strings

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** pattern "[0-9]+", **When** matched against "abc123def", **Then** it should match "123"
2. **Given** pattern "a.*b", **When** matched against "axxxb", **Then** it should match the full span
3. **Given** pattern "test?", **When** matched against "tes" and "test", **Then** it should match both

---

### User Story 3 - Groups and Alternation (Priority: P3)

Users need to use capturing groups (parentheses) and alternation (pipe operator) for complex pattern matching and extraction.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced regex patterns like email validation, phone number extraction, and multiple option matching

**Independent Test**: Can be tested with patterns like "(hello|world)", "(\d+)-(\d+)" against appropriate text

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** pattern "(hello|world)", **When** matched against "hello there", **Then** it should match "hello" and capture it
2. **Given** pattern "(\d+)-(\d+)", **When** matched against "123-456", **Then** it should capture "123" and "456" separately
3. **Given** nested groups, **When** matched, **Then** it should maintain correct capture hierarchy

### Edge Cases

- What happens when memory allocation fails during compilation?
- How does system handle invalid UTF-8 sequences in input text?
- What happens with extremely long patterns that exceed memory limits?
- How are deeply nested quantifiers handled to prevent exponential blowup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST compile RE2-compatible regex patterns into AST structures
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute pattern matching in O(n) time where n is input length  
- **FR-003**: System MUST use Odin's explicit memory management with new()/free() patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide complete RE2-compatible API surface
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle Unicode UTF-8 input correctly throughout

### Edge Case Requirements

- **FR-EC-001**: System MUST return MemoryError when pattern compilation exceeds configurable memory limits
- **FR-EC-002**: System MUST return UTF8Error with byte position when input text contains invalid UTF-8 sequences  
- **FR-EC-003**: System MUST reject patterns with nesting depth exceeding configurable limits with TooComplex error
- **FR-EC-004**: System MUST maintain O(n) complexity for pathological quantifier patterns like "a*a*a*a*a*a*"

### RE2-Specific Requirements *(if regex feature)*

- **FR-RE2-001**: Implementation MUST preserve RE2's linear-time complexity guarantee
- **FR-RE2-002**: AST structures MUST match RE2 exactly (no deviations)
- **FR-RE2-003**: Memory usage MUST be bounded with configurable DFA state cache
- **FR-RE2-004**: Full Unicode UTF-8 support MUST match RE2 behavior
- **FR-RE2-005**: No exponential backtracking patterns permitted

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Regexp_Pattern**: Compiled regex pattern containing AST and memory arena
- **Regexp**: AST node representing parsed regex structure with operators and data
- **Match_Result**: Result structure containing match status, ranges, and captures
- **Arena**: Memory arena for efficient allocation and cleanup of regex structures
- **ErrorCode**: Enum defining all possible error states matching RE2 semantics

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All RE2 test cases pass without modification (100% compatibility)
- **SC-002**: Performance within 2x of native RE2 implementation on common patterns
- **SC-003**: Memory usage remains bounded even with pathological patterns
- **SC-004**: Zero memory leaks in all test scenarios (verified with Odin's memory tools)
- **SC-005**: Complete API coverage allowing drop-in replacement for RE2 in Odin code
