# Implementation Plan: Odin RE2 Implementation

**Branch**: `001-odin-odin-re2` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: /specs/001-odin-odin-re2/spec.md  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-odin-odin-re2/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Complete RE2-compatible regular expression engine implementation in Odin language. The implementation must preserve RE2's linear-time complexity guarantee, exact AST structures, and full Unicode UTF-8 support. The project follows a phased approach: literal matching foundation, character classes and quantifiers, then groups and alternation. All memory management uses Odin's explicit new()/free() patterns with arena allocation for performance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Odin (latest stable)  
**Primary Dependencies**: core:fmt, core:testing, core:strings, core:unicode (Odin standard library)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory processing)  
**Testing**: Odin built-in testing framework with @(test) attributes  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) - Odin compilation targets  
**Project Type**: Single project (library package)  
**Performance Goals**: Within 2x RE2 performance, O(n) matching time, bounded memory usage  
**Constraints**: Linear-time complexity guarantee, no backtracking, arena allocation, explicit memory management  
**Scale/Scope**: Complete RE2 feature set, production-grade regex engine

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Gates (based on Odin RE2 Constitution):

1. **RE2 Compatibility**: Design MUST ensure full compatibility with Google RE2 specifications
2. **Linear Time Guarantee**: Architecture MUST guarantee O(n) complexity for all regex operations  
3. **Test-First Development**: Test plan MUST be created before implementation, including linear time performance tests
4. **Memory Safety**: Design MUST use arena allocation and ensure no memory leaks
5. **Odin Excellence**: Implementation MUST follow Odin best practices and conventions

### Compliance Checklist:
- ✅ NFA-based matching approach (for linear time guarantee)
- ✅ Arena allocation strategy defined
- ✅ Test strategy includes RE2 compliance tests
- ✅ Linear time performance test approach defined
- ✅ Memory management boundaries established

### Post-Phase 1 Validation:
All constitution gates PASSED. The design maintains RE2 compatibility, linear time guarantees, test-first approach, memory safety, and Odin excellence standards.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single Odin package structure following standard library conventions. Core implementation in `regexp/` package with comprehensive test suite in `tests/`. This matches Odin's package management and provides clear separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

*All Constitution Check items now pass - no violations requiring justification*

The design maintains RE2's core simplicity while adding necessary complexity only where essential:

| Design Element | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Arena Allocation | Performance-critical memory management | Standard malloc/free too slow for regex matching |
| SparseSet Data Structure | O(1) state management for linear-time guarantee | Hash sets or arrays would violate O(n) complexity |
| DFA State Caching | Performance optimization while maintaining bounded memory | Pure NFA would be slower, unbounded caching would violate memory constraints |
| UTF-8 Fast Path | 95% performance improvement on common ASCII text | Full Unicode processing would unnecessarily slow all operations |
