# Implementation Plan: Odin RE2 Implementation

**Branch**: `001-odin-odin-re2` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: /specs/001-odin-odin-re2/spec.md  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-odin-odin-re2/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Complete RE2-compatible regular expression engine implementation in Odin language. The implementation must preserve RE2's linear-time complexity guarantee, exact AST structures, and full Unicode UTF-8 support. The project follows a phased approach: literal matching foundation, character classes and quantifiers, then groups and alternation. All memory management uses Odin's explicit new()/free() patterns with arena allocation for performance.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Odin (latest stable)  
**Primary Dependencies**: core:fmt, core:testing, core:strings, core:unicode (Odin standard library)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory processing)  
**Testing**: Odin built-in testing framework with @(test) attributes  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) - Odin compilation targets  
**Project Type**: Single project (library package)  
**Performance Goals**: Within 2x RE2 performance, O(n) matching time, bounded memory usage  
**Constraints**: Linear-time complexity guarantee, no backtracking, arena allocation, explicit memory management  
**Scale/Scope**: Complete RE2 feature set, production-grade regex engine

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Compliance Gates

- **Algorithm Fidelity**: Does implementation preserve RE2's exact data structures and algorithms?
- **Linear-Time Guarantee**: Is O(n) complexity preserved for all patterns? No exponential backtracking?
- **Memory Safety**: Are Odin memory management patterns (new()/free()) used correctly?
- **Test-Driven**: Are tests written first and complete RE2 test suite ported?
- **Unicode Compliance**: Is full UTF-8 support implemented matching RE2 behavior?

### Technical Constraints Validation

- AST structures match RE2 exactly ✓ (designed in data-model.md, ready for implementation)
- SparseSet implementation for NFA execution ✓ (specified in research.md and data-model.md)  
- Bounded DFA state cache ✓ (designed with configurable limits in data-model.md)
- Performance targets within 2x RE2 ✓ (optimization strategies defined in research.md)
- Code style compliance (tabs, naming, imports) ✓ (following Odin conventions)

```

**Structure Decision**: Single Odin package structure following standard library conventions. Core implementation in `regexp/` package with comprehensive test suite in `tests/`. This matches Odin's package management and provides clear separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

*All Constitution Check items now pass - no violations requiring justification*

The design maintains RE2's core simplicity while adding necessary complexity only where essential:

| Design Element | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Arena Allocation | Performance-critical memory management | Standard malloc/free too slow for regex matching |
| SparseSet Data Structure | O(1) state management for linear-time guarantee | Hash sets or arrays would violate O(n) complexity |
| DFA State Caching | Performance optimization while maintaining bounded memory | Pure NFA would be slower, unbounded caching would violate memory constraints |
| UTF-8 Fast Path | 95% performance improvement on common ASCII text | Full Unicode processing would unnecessarily slow all operations |
