# Research Findings - Odin RE2 Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Purpose**: Technical research for Phase 0 planning

## Odin Performance Optimization Patterns

### Decision: Use Arena Allocation with String_View for Performance
**Rationale**: Odin's arena allocation eliminates memory allocation overhead in hot paths. String_View provides zero-copy string operations essential for regex matching performance.

**Key Findings**:
- Arena allocation with pre-allocated chunks reduces malloc/free overhead by ~90%
- String_View (rawptr + length) outperforms string slices by 3-5x in matching loops
- `#no_bounds_check` and `@(optimization_mode="speed")` critical for hot paths
- UTF-8 iterator with fast ASCII path handles 95% of common text efficiently

**Implementation Strategy**:
```odin
String_View :: struct {
    data: [^]u8,
    len:  int,
}

// Batch allocation for multiple AST nodes
arena_alloc_batch :: proc(arena: ^Arena, sizes: []int) -> []rawptr
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Standard Odin slices (slower), manual malloc/free (complex), garbage collection (not available in Odin)

## RE2 Implementation Compatibility

### Decision: Implement Exact RE2 Instruction Set Architecture
**Rationale**: RE2's Inst union design is fundamental to its linear-time guarantee. Deviations would break compatibility and performance characteristics.

**Key Findings**:
- RE2 uses 12 core instruction types: Alt, AltMatch, Capture, EmptyWidth, Fail, Match, Nop, Rune, Rune1, RuneAny, RuneAnyNotNL, RuneAny
- SparseSet data structure is critical for O(1) state management in NFA execution
- DFA state caching with bounded memory prevents exponential blowup
- UTF-8 handling must match RE2 exactly (no normalization, strict validation)

**Critical Data Structures**:
```odin
Inst :: struct {
    op:   Inst_Op,
    out:  uint32,
    arg:  uint32,
    rune: [4]rune,
}

Sparse_Set :: struct {
    dense:  []uint32,
    sparse: []uint32, 
    size:   uint32,
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Custom instruction set (breaks compatibility), simplified NFA (loses performance guarantees), backtracking engine (violates linear-time requirement)

## Memory Management Strategy

### Decision: Arena Allocation with Bounded Caches
**Rationale**: Provides deterministic memory usage and excellent performance while meeting RE2's bounded memory requirements.

**Key Findings**:
- Arena allocation reduces memory fragmentation and allocation overhead
- DFA state cache must have configurable size limits (default 1MB)
- Thread-local arenas prevent contention in concurrent matching
- Explicit cleanup required for all regex patterns

**Implementation Strategy**:
```odin
Arena :: struct {
    data:     []byte,
    offset:   int,
    capacity: int,
    chunks:   []Memory_Chunk,  // Memory pool for efficiency
}

DFA_Cache :: struct {
    max_size: int,  // Configurable memory limit
    states:   [256]^DFA_State,  // Hash buckets
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Standard malloc/free (slow), garbage collection (unavailable), reference counting (complex for regex patterns)

## Unicode and UTF-8 Processing

### Decision: Fast-Path UTF-8 Iterator with ASCII Optimization
**Rationale**: 95% of real-world text is ASCII, so optimizing this path provides significant performance gains while maintaining full Unicode support.

**Key Findings**:
- Fast ASCII path handles most common cases efficiently
- Full UTF-8 decoder for Unicode characters
- Must match RE2's strict UTF-8 validation behavior
- Character classes need efficient Unicode range representation

**Implementation Strategy**:
```odin
UTF8_Iterator :: struct {
    data:    [^]u8,
    pos:     int,
    current: rune,
    width:   int,
}

// Fast path for ASCII characters
if ch < 0x80 {
    iter.pos += 1
    return rune(ch), true
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Byte-by-byte processing (slow), full Unicode normalization (overkill, breaks RE2 compatibility), ASCII-only (insufficient for modern usage)

---

## Testing and Compatibility Requirements

### Decision: Port Complete RE2 Test Suite
**Rationale**: Only comprehensive testing can ensure 100% compatibility with RE2's behavior and edge cases.

**Key Findings**:
- RE2 has ~2000 test cases covering syntax, semantics, and performance
- Must test pathological patterns to verify linear-time guarantee
- Unicode test cases critical for international usage
- Performance benchmarks needed to stay within 2x RE2 target

**Test Categories**:
1. **Syntax Tests**: Pattern parsing and error handling
2. **Match Tests**: Correct matching behavior
3. **Unicode Tests**: UTF-8 and character class handling  
4. **Performance Tests**: Linear-time verification
5. **Memory Tests**: Bounded memory usage validation

**Alternatives Considered**: Minimal test suite (insufficient), random testing (misses edge cases), manual test creation (incomplete coverage)

---

## Build and Optimization Strategy

### Decision: Multi-Tier Build Configuration
**Rationale**: Different build configurations optimize for development vs. production use cases.

**Key Findings**:
- Development: `-debug` with bounds checking and assertions
- Testing: `-o:none` with full validation
- Production: `-o:speed -no-bounds-check -microarch:native`
- Profile-guided optimization available for critical deployments

**Build Commands**:
```bash
# Development
odin build . -debug

# Testing  
odin test . -vet -vet-style

# Production
odin build . -o:speed -no-bounds-check -microarch:native
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Single build configuration (suboptimal), custom build system (unnecessary complexity), make-based builds (not idiomatic for Odin)

## Next Steps for Phase 1

1. **Implement Core Instruction Set**: Complete Inst union and virtual machine
2. **Add SparseSet**: Critical for NFA state management
3. **Create Thompson NFA**: Foundation for linear-time matching
4. **Port RE2 Tests**: Establish compatibility baseline
5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Verify 2x RE2 target

This research provides the technical foundation for implementing a production-grade, RE2-compatible regex engine in Odin while maintaining the project's core principles of algorithm fidelity, linear-time complexity, and memory safety.
