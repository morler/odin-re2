# Feature Specification: Odin RE2 Performance Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `002-description-context-odin`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "根据以上建议制定新需求故事"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Linear Time Regex Matching (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Odin RE2, I need the regex engine to process patterns in linear time so that my applications remain responsive even with complex patterns and large texts.

**Why this priority**: The current exponential complexity makes the engine unusable for production workloads, causing timeouts and poor user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the existing performance benchmark suite and verifying all scenarios complete within acceptable time limits (under 1 second for standard test cases).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complex quantifier pattern like `([A-Z][a-z]+\d+){2,4}`, **When** matching against 60-character text, **Then** the operation completes in under 10 milliseconds
2. **Given** a star quantifier pattern like `a*`, **When** matching against 10-character text, **Then** the operation completes in under 1 millisecond
3. **Given** any supported regex pattern, **When** matching against text up to 1MB, **Then** the operation completes in time proportional to text length (linear relationship)

### User Story 2 - Backward Compatibility Preservation (Priority: P1)

As a developer with existing Odin RE2 code, I need the optimized engine to maintain full API compatibility so that my existing code continues to work without modifications.

**Why this priority**: Breaking changes would prevent adoption and force costly rewrites of existing applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested through phased compatibility validation: Phase 1 - API signature compatibility, Phase 2 - behavioral consistency, Phase 3 - performance regression testing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all existing test cases from the functionality suite, **When** executed in Phase 1 API compatibility testing, **Then** 100% of API signatures remain compatible
2. **Given** the current public API functions, **When** tested in Phase 2 behavioral consistency, **Then** at least 95% return the same result types and formats
3. **Given** existing error conditions, **When** validated in Phase 3 performance testing, **Then** error handling maintains minimal performance overhead

---

### User Story 3 - Performance Benchmarking (Priority: P2)

As a system maintainer, I need comprehensive performance benchmarks to validate that the optimization delivers the expected improvements and prevents regressions.

**Why this priority**: Without measurable validation, we cannot confirm the optimization success or detect future performance regressions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the benchmark suite and comparing results against baseline measurements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the performance benchmark suite, **When** executed, **Then** all scenarios complete without timeout
2. **Given** simple pattern matching tests, **When** compared to baseline, **Then** performance improves by at least 50%
3. **Given** complex pattern matching tests, **When** compared to baseline, **Then** performance improves by at least 90%

---

### User Story 4 - Memory Usage Optimization (Priority: P3)

As a developer deploying memory-constrained applications, I need the regex engine to use memory efficiently so that my applications remain within acceptable memory limits.

**Why this priority**: Current recursive implementation may cause stack overflow and excessive memory usage with complex patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by monitoring memory consumption during pattern matching operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** complex nested patterns, **When** matching, **Then** memory usage remains bounded and predictable
2. **Given** large text inputs, **When** matching, **Then** memory usage scales linearly with text size
3. **Given** concurrent matching operations, **When** executed, **Then** total memory usage stays within reasonable limits

### Edge Cases

- What happens when extremely large quantifier ranges are specified (e.g., `{1000000,2000000}`)?
- How does system handle pathological regex patterns that typically cause ReDoS attacks?
- What happens when matching against empty strings or patterns?
- How does system handle Unicode text with multi-byte characters?
- What happens when system memory is exhausted during matching operations?
