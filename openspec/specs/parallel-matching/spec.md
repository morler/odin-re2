# parallel-matching Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-multithreading-support. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Parallel Text Processing
The regex engine SHALL support parallel processing of large text inputs using multiple worker threads to improve matching performance.

#### Scenario: Large Text File Processing
- **WHEN** a 100KB text file is searched with a complex regex pattern using 4 worker threads
- **THEN** the operation SHALL complete at least 2x faster than single-threaded execution
- **AND** the match result SHALL be identical to single-threaded execution

#### Scenario: Worker Thread Configuration
- **WHEN** user configures the matcher to use 8 worker threads for their 8-core CPU
- **THEN** the matcher SHALL utilize up to 8 threads for processing
- **AND** performance SHALL scale appropriately with thread count

### Requirement: Text Chunking with Overlap
The regex engine SHALL split input text into chunks that can be processed independently while ensuring boundary matches aren't missed.

#### Scenario: Boundary Match Preservation
- **WHEN** a regex pattern that could match across chunk boundaries is used
- **AND** text is split into 4KB chunks with 64-byte overlap
- **THEN** matches that span chunk boundaries SHALL be correctly identified
- **AND** no matches SHALL be lost due to chunking

#### Scenario: Adaptive Chunk Size
- **WHEN** input texts of varying sizes (1KB to 1MB) are processed
- **THEN** chunk size SHALL be automatically adjusted based on text size
- **AND** optimal performance SHALL be maintained across different text lengths

### Requirement: Result Aggregation
The regex engine SHALL combine results from parallel workers to produce the correct leftmost-longest match.

#### Scenario: Multiple Worker Results
- **WHEN** 4 worker threads each find potential matches in their chunks
- **AND** results are aggregated
- **THEN** the final result SHALL follow leftmost-longest semantics
- **AND** results SHALL be identical to single-threaded execution

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility
The regex engine SHALL ensure existing API continues to work unchanged while adding parallel capabilities.

#### Scenario: Existing Code Compatibility
- **WHEN** existing code uses the current single-threaded matcher API
- **AND** multithreading changes are implemented
- **THEN** all existing code SHALL continue to work without modification
- **AND** performance characteristics for small texts SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Opt-in Parallel Mode
- **WHEN** user wants to enable parallel processing for large texts
- **AND** they use the new parallel matching API
- **THEN** parallel processing SHALL be enabled only when explicitly requested
- **AND** small texts SHALL automatically use single-threaded mode

### Requirement: Performance Thresholds
The regex engine SHALL automatically enable parallel processing only when it provides benefit.

#### Scenario: Small Text Optimization
- **WHEN** a 1KB text input is processed (where parallel overhead would exceed benefit)
- **THEN** single-threaded execution SHALL be used automatically
- **AND** no performance penalty SHALL be incurred

#### Scenario: Large Text Acceleration
- **WHEN** a 100KB text input is processed with multiple threads
- **THEN** parallel processing SHALL be used automatically or via API
- **AND** significant performance improvement SHALL be achieved

### Requirement: Resource Management
The regex engine SHALL efficiently manage thread resources and memory allocation for parallel processing.

#### Scenario: Thread Pool Lifecycle
- **WHEN** multiple regex matching operations are performed sequentially
- **AND** each operation completes
- **THEN** thread resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
- **AND** no thread or memory leaks SHALL occur

#### Scenario: Memory Allocation
- **WHEN** parallel processing with 4 worker threads is performed
- **AND** each thread allocates memory for matching operations
- **THEN** memory overhead SHALL be <5% of single-threaded allocation
- **AND** arena allocation SHALL be used per-thread to avoid contention
