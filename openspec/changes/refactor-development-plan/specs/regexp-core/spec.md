## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Memory Leak Prevention
The regexp engine SHALL properly manage arena allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks.

#### Scenario: Test execution without leaks
- **WHEN** running `odin test .`
- **THEN** no memory leak warnings should be reported
- **AND** all allocated arenas should be properly freed

#### Scenario: Pattern compilation and cleanup
- **WHEN** compiling and freeing multiple regex patterns
- **THEN** all associated memory should be released
- **AND** no memory growth should occur over repeated operations

### Requirement: Code Organization
The regexp core module SHALL be organized into clear functional sections with proper documentation.

#### Scenario: Code readability
- **WHEN** examining `regexp/regexp.odin`
- **THEN** distinct functional areas should be clearly marked with comments
- **AND** related functions should be grouped together

#### Scenario: Maintainable structure
- **WHEN** adding new features or fixing bugs
- **THEN** the code structure should allow easy location of relevant code
- **AND** changes should not require modifications across multiple unrelated sections

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Test Coverage
The regexp engine SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage for core functionality.

#### Scenario: Basic functionality testing
- **WHEN** running the test suite
- **THEN** all basic regex operations should be tested
- **AND** edge cases and error conditions should be covered

#### Scenario: Regression prevention
- **WHEN** making code changes
- **THEN** existing tests should continue to pass
- **AND** new tests should cover the changed functionality
