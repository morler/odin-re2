## Context
The Odin RE2 engine currently implements basic regex functionality but lacks several critical features required for full RE2 compatibility. The current implementation focuses on literal matching, character classes, basic quantifiers, and simple anchors. However, users expect advanced regex features like word boundaries, backreferences, lookaheads, lazy quantifiers, and Unicode properties.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: 
  - Achieve RE2 compatibility for commonly used regex features
  - Maintain linear-time performance guarantees where possible
  - Provide clear error messages for unsupported constructs
  - Keep memory usage predictable and efficient
- Non-Goals:
  - Implement every possible regex extension (focus on RE2 core features)
  - Support PCRE-specific extensions not in RE2
  - Sacrifice performance for edge-case functionality

## Decisions
- Decision: Implement word boundaries using Unicode word character detection
  - Alternatives considered: ASCII-only word boundaries, locale-specific word boundaries
  - Rationale: Unicode word boundaries provide the most useful behavior and match RE2 semantics

- Decision: Support both numeric (`\1`) and named (`\g{name}`) backreferences
  - Alternatives considered: Only numeric backreferences, only named backreferences
  - Rationale: Both forms are commonly used and provide flexibility for different regex styles

- Decision: Implement lookahead assertions as zero-width matches
  - Alternatives considered: Simulate lookaheads with capture groups, skip lookaheads entirely
  - Rationale: Zero-width lookaheads provide the correct semantics and are essential for many patterns

- Decision: Fix lazy quantifiers by modifying NFA compilation
  - Alternatives considered: Implement separate lazy matching engine, use backtracking for lazy quantifiers
  - Rationale: Modifying NFA compilation maintains linear-time guarantees while providing correct lazy behavior

- Decision: Use pre-computed Unicode property tables
  - Alternatives considered: Runtime Unicode property calculation, external Unicode data files
  - Rationale: Pre-computed tables provide fast lookup and avoid external dependencies

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Performance risk: Backreferences and lookaheads may impact linear-time guarantees
  - Mitigation: Implement these features with careful optimization and document performance characteristics
- Memory risk: Unicode property tables may increase binary size
  - Mitigation: Use compressed tables and only include commonly used properties
- Complexity risk: Adding many features may increase code complexity
  - Mitigation: Implement features incrementally with comprehensive testing

## Migration Plan
1. Implement word boundaries (lowest risk, high value)
2. Fix lazy quantifiers (fix existing broken functionality)
3. Add backreference support (moderate complexity)
4. Implement lookahead assertions (higher complexity)
5. Enhance Unicode properties (data-intensive)
6. Integration testing and performance validation

Each step will include comprehensive tests and can be rolled back independently if issues arise.

## Open Questions
- Should we implement conditional backreferences (e.g., `(?(1)then|else)`)?
- How should we handle invalid backreferences (referring to non-existent groups)?
- Should we support Unicode property aliases beyond the standard names?
- How should we balance between performance and completeness for Unicode scripts?
