## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Word Boundary Matching (RE2 Compatible)
The matcher SHALL implement ASCII word boundary detection matching RE2 semantics exactly.

#### Scenario: Word boundary at string start
- **WHEN** matching `\b` at position 0 of string
- **THEN** match if first character is ASCII word character ([0-9A-Za-z_])

#### Scenario: Word boundary between word and non-word characters
- **WHEN** matching `\b` between ASCII word character and non-word character
- **THEN** match successfully at the boundary position

#### Scenario: Non-word boundary matching
- **WHEN** matching `\B` between two ASCII word characters
- **THEN** match successfully at the position

#### Scenario: Word boundary with Unicode characters
- **WHEN** matching `\b` with Unicode characters
- **THEN** use ASCII word character definition only (per RE2 spec)

### Requirement: Lazy Quantifier Matching (RE2 Compatible)
The matcher SHALL implement non-greedy quantifier behavior that prefers minimal matches while maintaining linear-time complexity.

#### Scenario: Lazy star minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a*?` against "aaa"
- **THEN** prefer matching empty string first, then expand as needed for overall match

#### Scenario: Lazy plus minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a+?` against "aaa"
- **THEN** match single "a" first, then expand as needed for overall match

#### Scenario: Lazy question minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a??` against "a"
- **THEN** prefer matching empty string first

#### Scenario: Lazy repeat minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a{1,3}?` against "aaa"
- **THEN** match single "a" first, then expand as needed for overall match

#### Scenario: Lazy quantifier with alternation
- **WHEN** matching pattern with lazy quantifier followed by alternation
- **THEN** correctly prioritize minimal match to enable successful overall pattern

### Requirement: Unicode Property Matching (RE2 Compatible)
The matcher SHALL implement Unicode script and category property matching using RE2's exact semantics.

#### Scenario: Unicode script property matching
- **WHEN** matching `\p{Greek}` against "α"
- **THEN** match successfully if character belongs to Greek script

#### Scenario: Negated Unicode property matching
- **WHEN** matching `\P{Latin}` against "α"
- **THEN** match successfully if character doesn't belong to Latin script

#### Scenario: Unicode category property matching
- **WHEN** matching `\pN` against "5"
- **THEN** match successfully if character belongs to Number category

#### Scenario: Unicode property with multiple characters
- **WHEN** matching `\p{Greek}+` against "αβγ"
- **THEN** match all characters belonging to Greek script

#### Scenario: Mixed Unicode and ASCII properties
- **WHEN** matching pattern combining Unicode properties and ASCII characters
- **THEN** correctly apply each property type according to RE2 semantics

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: NFA Integration
The matcher SHALL integrate new features into the NFA compilation and execution process while maintaining linear-time guarantees.

#### Scenario: NFA compilation with new features
- **WHEN** compiling AST containing word boundaries, lazy quantifiers, or Unicode properties
- **THEN** generate appropriate NFA instructions for correct execution without backtracking

#### Scenario: NFA execution with new features
- **WHEN** executing NFA with new feature instructions
- **THEN** correctly handle the semantics during matching process in O(n) time

### Requirement: Error Handling for Non-RE2 Features
The matcher SHALL provide clear error messages when attempting to use features not supported by RE2.

#### Scenario: Clear error for backreferences
- **WHEN** user attempts to use pattern with backreference
- **THEN** provide clear message that backreferences are not supported in RE2

#### Scenario: Clear error for lookaheads
- **WHEN** user attempts to use pattern with lookahead
- **THEN** provide clear message that lookaheads are not supported in RE2
