## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Word Boundary Matching
The matcher SHALL implement word boundary detection using Unicode word character definitions.

#### Scenario: Word boundary at string start
- **WHEN** matching `\b` at position 0 of string
- **THEN** match if first character is a word character

#### Scenario: Word boundary between word and non-word characters
- **WHEN** matching `\b` between word character and non-word character
- **THEN** match successfully at the boundary position

#### Scenario: Non-word boundary matching
- **WHEN** matching `\B` between two word characters
- **THEN** match successfully at the position

#### Scenario: Word boundary with Unicode
- **WHEN** matching `\b` with Unicode word characters
- **THEN** correctly identify boundaries using Unicode word character properties

### Requirement: Backreference Matching
The matcher SHALL implement backreference resolution and matching against previously captured groups.

#### Scenario: Numeric backreference matching
- **WHEN** matching `\1` after capture group 1 has matched "test"
- **THEN** successfully match only if current text equals "test"

#### Scenario: Named backreference matching
- **WHEN** matching `\g{name}` after named capture group "name" has matched
- **THEN** successfully match only if current text equals the captured content

#### Scenario: Backreference with different capture content
- **WHEN** matching backreference to group that captured different content
- **THEN** fail match if current text doesn't equal the captured content

#### Scenario: Unmatched capture group backreference
- **WHEN** matching backreference to capture group that didn't participate
- **THEN** handle according to RE2 semantics (typically fail)

### Requirement: Lookahead Assertion Matching
The matcher SHALL implement zero-width lookahead assertions without consuming characters.

#### Scenario: Positive lookahead success
- **WHEN** matching `(?=test)` followed by "test"
- **THEN** match successfully without consuming "test"

#### Scenario: Positive lookahead failure
- **WHEN** matching `(?=test)` followed by "other"
- **THEN** fail match without consuming any characters

#### Scenario: Negative lookahead success
- **WHEN** matching `(?!test)` followed by "other"
- **THEN** match successfully without consuming "other"

#### Scenario: Negative lookahead failure
- **WHEN** matching `(?!test)` followed by "test"
- **THEN** fail match without consuming any characters

#### Scenario: Lookahead with complex patterns
- **WHEN** matching lookahead with quantifiers or alternation
- **THEN** correctly evaluate the complex assertion pattern

### Requirement: Lazy Quantifier Matching
The matcher SHALL implement non-greedy quantifier behavior that prefers minimal matches.

#### Scenario: Lazy star minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a*?` against "aaa"
- **THEN** prefer matching empty string first, then expand as needed

#### Scenario: Lazy plus minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a+?` against "aaa"
- **THEN** match single "a" first, then expand as needed

#### Scenario: Lazy question minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a??` against "a"
- **THEN** prefer matching empty string first

#### Scenario: Lazy repeat minimal matching
- **WHEN** matching `a{1,3}?` against "aaa"
- **THEN** match single "a" first, then expand as needed

### Requirement: Unicode Property Matching
The matcher SHALL implement Unicode script property matching using character classification.

#### Scenario: Unicode script property matching
- **WHEN** matching `\p{Latin}` against "a"
- **THEN** match successfully if character belongs to Latin script

#### Scenario: Negated Unicode property matching
- **WHEN** matching `\P{Latin}` against "α"
- **THEN** match successfully if character doesn't belong to Latin script

#### Scenario: Unicode property with multiple characters
- **WHEN** matching `\p{Greek}+` against "αβγ"
- **THEN** match all characters belonging to Greek script

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: NFA Integration
The matcher SHALL integrate new features into the NFA compilation and execution process.

#### Scenario: NFA compilation with new features
- **WHEN** compiling AST containing word boundaries, backreferences, or lookaheads
- **THEN** generate appropriate NFA instructions for correct execution

#### Scenario: NFA execution with new features
- **WHEN** executing NFA with new feature instructions
- **THEN** correctly handle the semantics during matching process
