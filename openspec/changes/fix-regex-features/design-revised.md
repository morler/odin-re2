## Context
The Odin RE2 engine aims to be a complete Google RE2-compatible implementation in Odin. Based on current analysis, Unicode properties are fully functional with excellent performance (7-10 ns/op), but word boundaries have integration issues and lazy quantifiers need implementation. The engine maintains 2253 MB/s throughput for existing features and must preserve this performance while adding missing RE2-compatible functionality.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: 
  - Achieve 100% Google RE2 compatibility for supported features
  - Maintain RE2's linear-time performance guarantees
  - Implement only features present in Google RE2 specification
  - Provide clear error messages for RE2-unsupported features
- Non-Goals:
  - Implement backreferences (NOT SUPPORTED by RE2)
  - Implement lookahead/lookbehind assertions (NOT SUPPORTED by RE2)
  - Support PCRE-specific extensions not in RE2
  - Sacrifice linear-time guarantees for additional features

## Decisions
- Decision: Implement ASCII-only word boundaries (per RE2 spec)
  - Alternatives considered: Unicode word boundaries, locale-specific boundaries
  - Rationale: RE2 specifically uses ASCII word boundaries (`\w` = `[0-9A-Za-z_]`)

- Decision: Fix lazy quantifiers within NFA framework
  - Alternatives considered: Separate lazy matching engine, backtracking
  - Rationale: Must maintain RE2's linear-time guarantee

- Decision: Implement Unicode properties using RE2's exact syntax
  - Alternatives considered: Extended Unicode support, PCRE-compatible syntax
  - Rationale: Must match RE2's `\p{Greek}` and `\pN` syntax exactly

- Decision: Explicitly reject non-RE2 features with clear errors
  - Alternatives considered: Silent failure, partial implementation
  - Rationale: Users should know they're using non-RE2 features

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Compatibility risk: Implementing too many features could break RE2 compatibility
  - Mitigation: Strictly follow Google RE2 syntax specification
- Performance risk: Unicode properties may impact performance
  - Mitigation: Use optimized lookup tables and lazy loading
- User confusion risk: Users may expect PCRE features
  - Mitigation: Clear documentation and error messages

## Migration Plan
1. **Fix word boundary integration** (resolve module import issues, high impact, low risk)
2. **Implement lazy quantifiers** (add missing RE2 feature, medium complexity)
3. **Enhance Unicode property coverage** (extend existing working implementation)
4. **Add comprehensive error handling** (document non-RE2 feature exclusions)
5. **Performance validation** (ensure 2253 MB/s throughput is maintained)

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Current Performance Baseline
- **State Vector Optimization**: 2253 MB/s throughput
- **Unicode Property Lookup**: 7-10 ns/op with ASCII fast-path (95% optimization)
- **Memory Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction via arena allocation
- **Compilation Speed**: 1800-11600ns per pattern

### Expected Performance Impact
- **Word Boundaries**: <5% overhead (ASCII character classification)
- **Lazy Quantifiers**: <10% overhead (additional NFA state tracking)
- **Unicode Property Enhancement**: <3% overhead (extended lookup tables)
- **Overall Target**: Maintain >2000 MB/s throughput for all features

## RE2 Compatibility Matrix
| Feature | RE2 Status | Current Odin Status | Action |
|---------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Word boundaries `\b`, `\B` | ✅ Supported | ❌ Compile error | **Implement** |
| Lazy quantifiers `*?`, `+?` | ✅ Supported | ❌ Wrong behavior | **Fix** |
| Unicode properties `\p{Greek}` | ✅ Supported | ⚠️ Limited | **Enhance** |
| Backreferences `\1`, `\g{name}` | ❌ NOT SUPPORTED | ❌ Not implemented | **Document exclusion** |
| Lookaheads `(?=...)` | ❌ NOT SUPPORTED | ❌ Not implemented | **Document exclusion** |
| Named groups `(?P<name>...)` | ✅ Supported | ✅ Working | **Maintain** |

## Open Questions
- Which Unicode scripts should be prioritized for the initial implementation?
- How should we handle invalid Unicode property names (follow RE2 behavior)?
- Should we provide migration guide for PCRE users transitioning to RE2?
