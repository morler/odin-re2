# Implementation Tasks: Add Multithreading Support

## Phase 1: Basic Parallel Framework

### Task 1: Implement Thread Worker Pool
**Description**: Create basic worker thread infrastructure for parallel matching.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add `Thread_Worker` struct to manage individual worker threads
- Implement `worker_thread_proc` function for thread execution
- Create thread-safe task queue using Odin channels
- Add basic worker lifecycle management (start/stop)

**Validation**:
- Unit test worker creation and destruction
- Verify no thread leaks during operation
- Test basic task processing functionality

**Dependencies**: None

### Task 2: Add Text Chunking Algorithm
**Description**: Implement text splitting logic with boundary overlap for parallel processing.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add `create_text_chunks()` function with configurable chunk size
- Implement overlap logic (default 64 bytes) to preserve boundary matches
- Add adaptive chunk sizing based on input text length
- Handle edge cases for small texts (< chunk size)

**Validation**:
- Test chunking with various text sizes
- Verify boundary overlaps are correctly implemented
- Ensure no data loss during chunking process

**Dependencies**: Task 1

### Task 3: Implement Basic Parallel Matching
**Description**: Add core parallel matching functionality that coordinates workers.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add `parallel_nfa_match()` function as main parallel entry point
- Implement task dispatch to worker threads
- Add result collection from multiple workers
- Implement leftmost-longest result selection logic

**Validation**:
- Compare parallel vs single-threaded results for correctness
- Test with various patterns and text sizes
- Verify boundary matches are preserved

**Dependencies**: Task 1, Task 2

## Phase 2: Integration and API

### Task 4: Add Parallel API Interface
**Description**: Create user-facing API for enabling parallel processing.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add `Matcher_Config` struct for parallel options
- Extend existing matcher to support parallel mode
- Add `new_parallel_matcher()` constructor
- Implement automatic threshold detection (enable parallel only for large texts)

**Validation**:
- Test API backward compatibility
- Verify existing code continues to work unchanged
- Test parallel mode activation with various text sizes

**Dependencies**: Task 3

### Task 5: Integrate with Existing Memory System
**Description**: Connect parallel matcher with existing arena allocation system.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add per-thread arena allocation in worker threads
- Implement global arena for shared data structures
- Add memory usage tracking for parallel operations
- Ensure proper cleanup of thread-local resources

**Validation**:
- Monitor memory usage during parallel operations
- Verify no memory leaks in threaded execution
- Test memory overhead stays <5%

**Dependencies**: Task 4

## Phase 3: Performance and Validation

### Task 6: Add Performance Benchmarks
**Description**: Create comprehensive performance testing for parallel matching.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend existing performance test suite with parallel benchmarks
- Add tests for scaling with different worker counts
- Include tests for various text sizes and pattern complexities
- Add regression tests to prevent performance degradation

**Validation**:
- Verify 2-3x speedup on large texts (>64KB) with 4 cores
- Test performance scaling with worker count
- Ensure no performance regression for small texts

**Dependencies**: Task 5

### Task 7: Add Correctness Validation
**Description**: Ensure parallel results are identical to single-threaded execution.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add comprehensive correctness test suite
- Test edge cases (empty matches, boundary conditions)
- Add stress tests with concurrent operations
- Verify leftmost-longest semantics are preserved

**Validation**:
- All existing tests must pass with parallel implementation
- Randomized testing comparing parallel vs serial results
- Long-running stress tests for thread safety

**Dependencies**: Task 6

### Task 8: Documentation and Examples
**Description**: Document the new parallel functionality and provide usage examples.

**Implementation Details**:
- Update API documentation with parallel options
- Add usage examples showing when and how to use parallel matching
- Document performance characteristics and best practices
- Add migration guide for existing code

**Validation**:
- Documentation review for clarity and accuracy
- Example code verification
- User acceptance testing of documentation

**Dependencies**: Task 7

## Implementation Notes

### Parallelizable Work
- Tasks 1-3 can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Tasks 6-7 can run concurrently once Task 5 is complete

### Critical Path
Task 3 → Task 4 → Task 5 → Task 8 represents the main implementation sequence

### Risk Mitigation
- Each task includes comprehensive validation
- Early tasks (1-3) focus on core functionality before API changes
- Performance testing (Task 6) validates the primary success criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
All tasks must be completed with:
- Unit tests passing
- Performance benchmarks meeting targets
- Zero correctness regressions
- Documentation updated
