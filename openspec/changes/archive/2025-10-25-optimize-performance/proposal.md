# Performance Optimization Proposal

**Change ID**: 2025-10-25-optimize-performance  
**Target**: regex-engine spec performance requirements  
**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Priority**: High  

## Why

Current Odin RE2 implementation has solid functionality but critical performance gaps prevent production use. String search operates at 434 MB/s vs 2,000+ MB/s target, with 95% of real-world text processing using slow Unicode path instead of optimized ASCII fast path.

## What Changes

- **Add ASCII fast path**: O(1) character classification for 95% of text processing (3-5x speedup)
- **Implement SIMD optimization**: Vectorized character class matching on x86-64 (2-4x speedup for [a-z] patterns)
- **Optimize state vectors**: 64-byte aligned bit vectors for cache efficiency (50% reduction in state processing)
- **Fix module system**: Public API exports for proper benchmarking and testing
- **Add performance suite**: Comprehensive benchmarks to validate improvements and prevent regressions

## Summary

This change introduces critical performance optimizations to make Odin RE2 production-ready with 3-5x performance improvements for common regex operations while maintaining the current clean architecture.

## Problem Statement

Current Odin RE2 implementation lacks essential performance optimizations:
- ASCII text processing (95% of real-world usage) uses slow Unicode path
- No SIMD optimization for character classes
- State vectors not cache-optimized
- Module import issues prevent proper benchmarking
- Performance gaps: 434 MB/s vs 2,000+ MB/s target

## Proposed Changes

This change focuses on three core capabilities:

1. **ASCII Fast Path** - O(1) character classification for 95% of text
2. **Vector Operations** - SIMD and cache-optimized state management  
3. **Performance Validation** - Working benchmarks and test suite

## Architectural Impact

Minimal architectural changes:
- Add ASCII classification table to `utf8_optimized.odin`
- Enhance `matcher.odin` with SIMD character class matching
- Optimize state vectors in `memory.odin`
- Fix public API exports in `regexp.odin`
- Add performance test suite

## Success Criteria

**Performance Targets**:
- String search: >2,000 MB/s (current: 434 MB/s)
- Character iteration: >1,500 MB/s (current: 46 MB/s)
- Pattern matching: >1,200 MB/s
- Compilation: <500 ns/pattern

**Functional Targets**:
- All existing tests pass
- Working performance benchmarks
- No regressions in functionality
- Module import system fixed

## Risk Assessment

Low-risk incremental changes with clear rollback points:
- ASCII fast path (isolated optimization)
- Module fixes (API cleanup)
- Performance tests (new code)
- SIMD feature flags (fallback available)

## Dependencies

- Odin compiler with SIMD intrinsics
- x86-64 test hardware with SSE2 support
- No external dependencies required
