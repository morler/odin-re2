## Parallel Work Items

### Continuous Tasks (Weeks 1-6):
- [ ] Monitor performance regression
- [ ] Update benchmarks as optimizations are added
- [ ] Maintain code quality standards
- [ ] Document design decisions and trade-offs

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Dependencies:
- Odin compiler with SIMD intrinsics support
- x86-64 test environment with SSE2
- Performance profiling tools

### Potential Blockers:
- SIMD intrinsics not available in target Odin version
- Module system changes require breaking changes
- Performance targets not achievable with current architecture

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Feature flags for SIMD support
- Fallback implementations for all optimizations
- Incremental rollout with performance checkpoints
- Rollback plan for each major change
