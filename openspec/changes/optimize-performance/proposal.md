# Performance Optimization Proposal

## Why
Based on comprehensive comparison testing with Google RE2, Odin RE2 demonstrates excellent compilation performance (2-2.5x faster) and memory efficiency (51% reduction), but matching performance needs optimization to reach production-ready standards. Current matching performance is 55-79% of Google RE2, with room for significant improvements in Unicode handling and NFA execution efficiency.

## What Changes
- **Unicode Enhancement**: Complete Unicode property support and UTF-8 optimization
- **NFA Performance**: Optimize state vector operations and instruction dispatch
- **Memory Access**: Improve cache locality and reduce memory access patterns
- **Parallel Processing**: Add optional parallel execution for large texts
- **DFA Optimization**: Implement selective DFA execution for simple patterns
- **Instruction Set**: Optimize NFA instruction encoding and execution

**BREAKING**: None - all optimizations maintain API compatibility

## Impact
- **Affected specs**:
  - `regexp-engine` (NFA matching performance)
  - `unicode-support` (UTF-8 and Unicode property handling)
  - `memory-management` (Arena allocation patterns)
  - `performance-optimization` (New capability for advanced optimizations)

- **Affected code**:
  - `regexp/matcher.odin` (NFA execution engine - primary optimization target)
  - `regexp/memory.odin` (Arena allocator enhancements)
  - `regexp/regexp.odin` (Main API and matching logic)
  - `regexp/parser.odin` (Unicode property parsing)
  - `benchmark/` (Performance testing and validation)

## Expected Outcomes
- **Match Performance**: Target 90%+ of Google RE2 performance
- **Unicode Support**: Complete Unicode property compatibility
- **Memory Efficiency**: Maintain 50%+ memory advantage
- **Compile Performance**: Preserve 2x+ compilation speed advantage
- **Scalability**: Better performance scaling with large inputs

## Risk Mitigation
- **Linear Time Guarantee**: All optimizations must maintain O(n) complexity
- **Memory Safety**: Preserve bounded memory usage and zero fragmentation
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to public API
- **Testing**: Comprehensive benchmarking to prevent regressions
